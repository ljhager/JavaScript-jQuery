		<p id='black'>Black absorbs all light in the color spectrum. It is often used as a symbol of menace or evil, but it is also popular as an indicator of power. It is used to represent treacherous characters such as Dracula and is often associated with witchcraft. Black is associated with death and mourning in many cultures. It is also associated with unhappiness, sexuality, formality, and sophistication. In ancient Egypt, black represented life and rebirth. Consider how black is used in language: Black Death, blackout, black cat, black list, black market, black tie, black belt.</p>
		<p id='white'>White represents purity or innocence. It is bright and can create a sense of space or add highlights. White is also described as cold, bland, and sterile. Rooms painted completely white can seem spacious, but empty and unfriendly.</p>
		<p id='red'>Red is a bright, warm color that evokes strong emotions. It is associated with love, warmth, and comfort. Red is also considered an intense, or even angry, color that creates feelings of excitement or intensity. Consider how red is used in language: redneck, red-hot, red-handed, paint the town red, seeing red.</p>
		<p id='blue'>Blue is described as a favorite color by many people and is the color most preferred by men. It calls to mind feelings of calmness or serenity. It is often described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly. Blue can also create feelings of sadness or aloofness. It is often used to decorate offices because research has shown that people are more productive in blue rooms. Blue is one of the most popular colors, but it is one of the least appetizing. Some weight loss plans even recommend eating your food off of a blue plate. Blue rarely occurs naturally in food aside from blueberries and some plums. Also, humans are geared to avoid foods that are poisonous and blue coloring in food is often a sign of spoilage or poison. Blue can also lower the pulse rate and body temperature. Consider how blue is used in language: blue moon, blue Monday, blue blood, the blues, and blue ribbon.</p>
		<p id='green'>Green is a cool color that symbolizes nature and the natural world. It also represents tranquility, good luck, health, and jealousy. Researchers have also found that green can improve reading ability. Some students may find that laying a transparent sheet of green paper over reading material increases reading speed and comprehension. Green has long been a symbol of fertility and was once the preferred color choice for wedding gowns in the 15th-century. Even today, green M & M's (an American chocolate candy) are said to send a sexual message. Green is often used in decorating for its calming effect. For example, guests waiting to appear on television programs often wait in a 'green room' to relax. Green is thought to relieve stress and help heal. Those who have a green work environment experience fewer stomachaches. Consider how green is used in language: green thumb, green with envy, greenhorn.</p>
		<p id='yellow'>Yellow is a bright color that is often described as cheery and warm. It is also the most fatiguing to the eye due to the high amount of light that is reflected. Using yellow as a background on paper or computer monitors can lead to eyestrain or vision loss in extreme cases. Yellow can also create feelings of frustration and anger. While it is considered a cheerful color, people are more likely to lose their tempers in yellow rooms and babies tend to cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow can also increase the metabolism. Since yellow is the most visible color, it is also the most attention-getting color. Yellow can be used in small amount to draw notice, such as on traffic sign or advertisements.</p>
		<p id='purple'>Purple is the symbol of royalty and wealth. Purple also represents wisdom and spirituality. Purple does not often occur in nature, it can sometimes appear exotic or artificial.</p>
		<p id='brown'>Brown is a natural color that evokes a sense of strength and reliability. It can also create feelings of sadness and isolation. Brown brings to mind feeling of warmth, comfort, and security. It is often described as natural, down-to-earth, and conventional, but brown can also be sophisticated.</p>
		<p id='orange'>Orange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is associated with joy, sunshine, the tropics, and it stimulates the appetite. Orange represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation. It is also highly visible, so it is used to catch attention as with warning signs.</p>
		<p id='pink'>Pink is essentially a light red and is usually associated with love and romance. It is thought to have a calming effect. One shade known as 'drunk-tank pink' is sometimes used in prisons to calm inmates. Sports teams sometimes paint the opposing teams locker room pink to keep the players passive and less energetic. While pink's calming effect has been demonstrated, researchers of color psychology have found that this effect only occurs during the initial exposure to the color. When used in prisons, inmates often become even more agitated once they become accustomed to the color.</p>
